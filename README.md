Sequential Anomaly Detection for Log Data Using Deep Learning

**This is a cooperative project with Volvo GTT and the goal is to do effective anomaly detection for company log data, however, we will not show any company data since it needs to be confidential.  We also used a public dataset to evaluate our methods which is the part we are going to present here**


The main sourse is a articel from logPAI: <https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/papers/deeplog.pdf>
